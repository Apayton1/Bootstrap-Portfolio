    <p>
      Hey! My name is Aquila. I love laughing. I also love to create.
      I have been creating things since I was about 8, from baking, to arts and crafts, to poetry.
      Although I am a newcomer to the field, I am truly excited for what’s to come.
      <br>
      The ability to take my ideas, or even someone else’s, and turn them into something concrete
      is an art that I am psyched to partake in.
      I speak Spanish, I play the acoustic guitar (although at a beginner’s level for now),
      I love to read, but NO fiction.
      <br>
      I believe that with every experience comes new views which have the ability to expand and deepen
      creativity, and so I welcome all experiences and challenge myself to learn something new from each
      of them.
      <br>
      I would like to become efficient in both front-end and back-end developing
      because it will assist me in my goal of helping others bring to life their businesses
      and brands by developing and managing their own online presence (website).
      Thanks for stopping by!
    </p>
